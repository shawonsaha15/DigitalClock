 A digital clock made and simulated in Logisim.
 Devices used to design the clock

 - OR Gates
 - XOR Gates
 - Decoders
 - T Flip-flops
 - Clock

 How it works:
 Go to 'Simulation' tab and click on 'Tick enabled' or use 'Ctrl+K' as a shortcut to run the device, change the tick frequence to set the speed of the clock.
